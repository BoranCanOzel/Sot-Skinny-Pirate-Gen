# Sea of Thieves Character Model Customization Proof of Concept

## :warning: Disclaimer
This project is a proof of concept for educational purposes only. It demonstrates potential memory manipulation techniques in gaming environments, specifically in Sea of Thieves (SOT). Modifying game memory can violate the game's Terms of Service and may lead to actions by the game developers. Users should apply this knowledge responsibly and ethically.

## :bulb: Project Overview
This repository showcases a conceptual approach to modify character models in SOT, aiming to make all randomized character creations skinny. It serves as an exploration of memory hooking techniques in video games. For a visual demonstration, check out this [YouTube Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd221x5-a6k).

## :star: Concept Features
- **Character Model Adjustment:** Conceptual method to alter character models during creation.
- **Memory Hooking Demonstration:** Shows the process of hooking into a game's memory for modifications.

## :books: Educational Purpose
- This project is intended as a learning resource for those interested in game development, memory manipulation, and ethical hacking.

## :gear: Conceptual Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of memory manipulation and ethical hacking principles.
- Interest in learning about game development and memory structures.

## :scroll: Note on Project Status
- This is an incomplete project and serves only as a proof of concept.
- It is not a fully functional tool and is not intended for actual use in modifying game memory.
